## Single developer, single machine: don't harden against shared/multi-tenant risks
tinkerbench runs locally on one developer's own machine via Herd, not as a shared internal server or multi-tenant service. It has no authentication and executes arbitrary PHP with no resource limits beyond the process itself. When reviewing or extending App\Support\Herd/snippet execution, don't propose defenses for risks that assume multiple concurrent users or other local OS accounts: output size caps to protect "other users" from one runaway snippet, temp file permission hardening against "other local accounts", rate limiting against multi-actor abuse, etc. A crash or resource exhaustion here affects only the developer running it and is self-recoverable with a restart. Reintroduce such defenses only if the deployment model changes to a shared/team instance.
