# General

## Consistency beats personal style
Consistency (naming, structure, testing style, mocking approach, route conventions) is the top-tier quality bar for this project, above cleverness or terseness. When a stylistic choice is ambiguous, check how the nearest comparable case was already solved in this codebase (or a cited reference project) before deciding, don't default to personal preference. Small deviations (a leading slash on a route, `test()` vs `it()`, a test name that leaks an internal collaborator name) are worth fixing, not "functionally identical, good enough".
